# Project-example-Depression-Forcast-For-Students-at-University
Due to the lockdown for pandemic, the percentage of depression in Germany increased dramatically especially for students in university. In this project, based on the provided dataset, we are aiming to use machine learning algorithms to predict level of depression from the features about lifestyle. After the analysis and visualization of data, we preprocess and transform the data into suitable form, then select the features and balance the original dataset. We use Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as our models and achieve relatively high accuracy after hyper-parameter tuning. The results indicate that our model could possibly be used to help psychologists with depression prediction in university.
